## What is Kinship Crew?

We are a self-organized, like minded group within the Kin Community focused on bringing meaningful contributions to the Kin Ecosystem. The group is open for anyone to join, share ideas and work together.

## Where and how can I contribute?

We'd love to collaborate with you! Getting started is really easy. Just pick an open [issue](https://github.com/KinshipFamily/Tasks/issues) (*work we've identified that needs doing*) and start contributing. The more love you give, the more love you get! :heart_eyes:
